#### Biography
Hello, my name is Pablo, and I am currently in my fourth year of a dual-degree program in Mathematics at [Dominican University](https://www.dom.edu/) and Mechanical Engineering at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/), with an expected graduation in May 2027. I am enthusiastic about human spaceflight engineering systems, operations, and engineering in extreme environments. I am currently an intern at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) in the Instrument Operations Engineering branch working on software for the [Sentinel-6](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/sentinel-6) series mission and [SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/). I have earned scuba diving certifications and continue to improve my strength, endurance, and academic skills, with the goal of participating in scientific and engineering fieldwork.
